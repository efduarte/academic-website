<h2>Short Bio</h2>

<p>{{ page.description }}</p>

## Areas of Expertise

- **Human-Computer Interaction**
	- Ubiquitous Computing (*i.e.*, tangible, full-body, IoT interactions)
	- Participatory Design (*i.e.*, co-design, methods and instruments) 
	- Interactive Installations (*i.e.*, educational, entertainment, artistic intervetions)

- **Informatics in Education**
	- Learning Theories (*i.e.*, constructionism, learning by doing, embodiment)
	- Computational Thinking (*i.e.*, not only "learning to program", but understanding and critical appropriation of technology)

I'm also open to explore new topics through project collaborations
or by supervising scientific initiation, master's and Ph.D students.
