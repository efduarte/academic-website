    abstract = {People’s interaction with computers has been explained through several theories and methods throughout the history of computers and their uses; more complex scenarios of ubiquitous and pervasive computing experimented nowadays invite other ways of considering human-technology interaction. The enactive approach to cognition, centered in human experience in the environment, has shown itself as a possibility to understand interaction in these new scenarios. In this paper we present a view of interaction, named socioenactive, to explain our relation with contemporary computational technologies in scenarios of ubiquitous and pervasive systems, understood from the enactivist perspective. After presenting core concepts related to intersubjectivity that helped to build up what we mean by socioenactive interaction, we illustrate it with some scenarios of ubiquitous and pervasive technology (situated in a school, a museum and a hospital), designed for the study of the phenomena of interaction. Graspable aspects of intersubjectivity are raised in the considered scenarios and affordances for the socioenactive interaction are illustrated. Implications of the study are discussed leading to aspects to consider in a research agenda in the field.}

    abstract = {As new technologies constantly change what we understand as a computer, Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) educators need to stay updated and prepare their students to work with an ever-growing number of socio-technical situations. This phenomenon constitutes a challenge for HCI syllabuses and practices, demanding diversified approaches to HCI education. In this article, we articulate Papert’s constructionism with Dewey’s theory of experience to propose an experience-based constructionism approach to practices in HCI education. We illustrate our approach in a case study with 55 computing undergraduate students engaged in the design and construction of open-ended, physical interactive artworks. Nine interactive artifacts were created. The students have shown an effective experience with our approach, reporting an expanded view of HCI, and demonstrating competence in appropriating new methods and instruments, suggesting the effectiveness of our approach to HCI education. Results of this work may encourage other HCI educators and practitioners to experience the proposed approach in their specific contexts.}

Despite considerable research on formal accessibility standards, related work has hardly investigated them in ubiquitous computing contexts. In this work, we investigate means of analyzing accessibility aspects in ubiquitous environments based on two standard instruments: the Universal Design (UD) Principles and Guidelines and the W3C-WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines of the World Wide Web Consortium). Both instruments were applied to the context of socioenactive ubiquitous environments, providing insights into their applicability and shortcomings. As a result of this analysis we constructed UbiAccess, an instrument to evaluate access in ubiquitous scenarios, which combines and extends characteristics of both UD and W3C-WCAG, filling in some of the gaps we identified. The application of UbiAccess to a case study shows the advantages of its use in informing the evaluation of access in ubiquitous scenarios.}",

We have experienced in the last years an impressive development in ubiquitous and pervasive systems, motivated by technological development, low cost of sensors and actuators, and a rise in the maker culture for the construction of computational systems. While such systems naturally inherit methods for evaluating the user interaction from previous interaction paradigms, it is not clear whether they reach specificities of the interaction of people within ubiquitous and pervasive systems scenarios. This work aimed at shedding light on this subject by conducting a systematic literature review on ubiquitous and pervasive technology scenarios of interactive installations. Results have shown that most of the selected contributions use classical methods of data collection and analysis, and combinations of these methods. Analysis of results also points out some new aspects to be considered in evaluation methods, regarding the human (social) actions promoted or afforded by ubiquitous and pervasive systems.},

    abstract = {The new scenarios brought by ubiquitous and pervasive technologies have drawn attention to design considerations towards integrating physical artefacts and digital processes. As for the human element in these scenarios, literature has emphasized individual bodies sensed by or acting with technology as social parties who participate in the environment. In this work, we draw on the enactivism-inspired perspective to cognition, to make explicit the social–physical–digital tripartite articulation into design considerations. The article proposes to clarify the tripartite coupling in the concept we are naming ‘socioenactive’. A case study carried out in the context of an educational workshop in an exploratory museum, with the use of installations designed on the deep time theme, illustrates some aspects of this tripartite relation. Data from the evaluation of the experience by children participating in the workshop, and from observations of intersubjective aspects of the experience made from recorded video, are presented and discussed. Results of the study clarify the main ideas behind an experience we are naming socioenactive, in its intersubjective aspects, and suggest lines to be weaved in design towards (smart) contemporary technology-based environments.}

    doi={10.5753/jis.2019.551},
    abstract={The mutual efforts of joining art and science have been an important source of innovation in many fields throughout history. In this article, we investigate the relatively common origins, differences, and similarities between the Interactive Art and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) areas of knowledge. We also investigate what kind of human-computer interactions are sought by artists or emerge in Interactive Art examples, as well as what kind of frameworks, evaluation criteria or methodologies are reported in the literature to support the design and evaluation of Interactive Art. As a result of our analysis of Interactive Art examples found in the literature and beyond, we derived four genres of dialogue that emerge naturally or are stressed by authors: visual, embodied, tangible and social. These genres, albeit not comprehensive, can inspire the design of novel forms of interaction in computational systems with or without artistic intent. Moreover, frameworks, evaluation criteria, and methodologies may allow a cross-pollination between Interactive Art and HCI. While interactive artists may provide novel ways to look at the design and evaluation of interactive systems, these artists may also benefit from appropriating traditional HCI methods, tools, and technologies for new purposes. Lastly, we draw on our findings and learned lessons to outline a research agenda with the main objectives of 1) encouraging Interactive Art research, 2) studying Interactive Art examples, 3) practicing Interactive Art design and evaluation, and 4) designing Interactive Art for all.},

    abstract="Interactive artifacts and environments that involve more aspects of life other than work (e.g., social relations, entertainment, art etc.) are gaining more attention within the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) field. This includes interactive art and installations. Do-It-Yourself (DIY) technologies, such as Arduinos with sensors and actuators, are often used in interactive installations. These technologies, however, are often oriented towards hobbyists and engineers. Moreover, easy-to-use commercial kits have a relatively high cost and a lack of flexibility. In this paper, we present Pincello: an affordable electronics kit for prototyping interactive installations. Pincello is not a commercial product, but rather a recommendation of components accompanied by meaningful hands-on documentation. We present and discuss the main components of the kit, including suggestions on how they can be used to allow different forms of interaction. We also present three case studies in which Pincello was used, involving 105 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) students. Considering how the kit received positive feedback in the three case studies, and how it was successfully used to create 18 installations of varied themes, Pincello has shown to be a promising tool for the design and construction of interactive installations.",

Ubiquitous Computing, Wearable Computing, Social Software, and the Internet of Things are examples of how ICT has permeated personal and collective life.

Therefore, designing technology now requires higher social awareness and responsibility, as well as ethical commitment from all stakeholders. Naturally, such a process demands for artifacts and methods grounded on different theories and practices, capable of facilitating the understanding of the social world and its complexity, in an effective way. In this paper, we introduce a Socially Aware Design (SAwD) system which is a CASE tool designed to support early design activities when a problem is understood and a solution is proposed. This tool aids to articulate ideas from Organizational Semiotics and Participatory Design. We present the theoretical and methodological grounds of our work about the design rationale for SAwD and how it disseminates both the practice of a socially aware design and an adoption of theories.",

Today, these surroundings often include ubiquitous and pervasive technologies that enable new interaction possibilities. Although imagination is an important aspect in the theory of enactivism, it remains unclear whether it has been investigated within the context of interactive installations, ubiquitous computing, or other kind of application that emphasizes embodiment. This article presents a systematic literature review investigating if and how imagination has been explored in ubiquitous scenarios of interactive installations. We found that ubiquitous technologies can play an important role in enabling imagination in interactive installations. There is, however, a need for more specific design and evaluation methods and theory adoption to support imagination in the design of interactive systems. On this need, we contribute wit h a research agenda for further study on this subject.}

    abstract={The social and physical distancing and the rapid transition to remote learning during pandemics had an impact on children's well-being. In this context, the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) field envisaged challenges to design and evaluate computational systems. In this paper, we propose an evaluation instrument considering socio-affective aspects of the experience, and present results from a pilot study to evaluate the Aquarela Virtual system. The Aquarela Virtual system allows remotely situated children to interact in a playful way with others by using physical objects related to a children's song, and emoticons to express their emotions. Based on findings of these evaluations, we provide insights on other aspects to be covered by our proposed evaluation instrument, and improvements in the system.},

    abstract={Gathering and understanding requirements and features in a system play a central role in its acceptance and proper use. Unconventional systems involving uncertainties about their requirements demand methods that adequately support the capture of stakeholder’s needs, desires and objectives. The OpenDesign project aims at supporting the design of computational solutions to wide-ranging problems under a holistic and socially-aware perspective through an open and collaborative platform. Designing this platform with a proper understanding of the desired features is for sure a hard task. In this paper, we investigate and characterize an ideation process to be used in situations involving uncertainties about requirements, as experienced in the OpenDesign Project. This process involves the collaborative construction of user stories, articulated with Socially Aware Design artifacts, created through participatory practices, as part of the platform design and prospection of potential uses of it . Based on the results, we organize the core concepts permeating the OpenDesign proposal, expressed in a map synthesizing its features.}

Our evolving relationship technology is a challenging topic of investigation, but alternative theories to cognition and socially aware empirical studies can shed light on the subject. In this paper, we explore "The Magic of Science" workshop, conducted in an educational museum context. With a background on learning through action and enactivism, our objective is to observe how people can individually and socially experience pervasive digital technology in educational contexts. Our study included 15 participant children and adolescents, who explored an exhibit of three interactive artworks and then built an interactive artifact from scratch during the workshop. We observed how these interactions took place and collected feedback on the experience of the workshop. Our results indicate that new ways of interacting with pervasive technologies allow us to expand the concept of learning through action, towards learning through socioenaction.}

The ubiquitous technology landscape through ubiquitous and pervasive technologies has brought new forms of interaction. In this context, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community has been directing efforts towards its methods. Among the challenges are the types of evaluations commonly performed to improve the quality of systems.In this work, we explored different methods to evaluate the user experience with nine interactive installations developed in a Human-Computer Interaction discipline project. The User Experience evaluation was made using AttrakDiff, which seeks to measure hedonic, pragmatic, and attractiveness qualities in an interaction. The second method was a combination of the Pleasure Framework (its thirteen categories of pleasure) and the Self-Assessment Manikin (SAM) in its Pleasure dimension. The choice of methods was given by the nature of the interactive installations, equally valuating pragmatic qualities as well as hedonic ones.The results show that triangulation approaches, such as the used in this work, were effective because they brought qualitative aspects of the experience, considering both pragmatic and hedonic aspects of the interaction. Particularly in our case study, artifacts with high hedonic qualities obtained good ratings in the pleasure categories.},

Results of this study illustrate the ways interaction approaches found in interactive art examples can inspire novel forms of interaction, which can also be useful in the design of interactive systems without artistic intent. Furthermore, frameworks and methodologies to support the design and evaluation of interactive art provide different ways to approach the design of interactive systems, giving focus to experiential aspects that otherwise could be overlooked.

    abstract={As interaction moves away from the screen into physical space, research on design techniques and practices is of central importance to cope with novel interaction possibilities. Participatory approaches are a viable strategy for the design of ubiquitous systems, however, going beyond early design phases is usually a challenge. In this work, we propose a design process that integrates technical and creative abilities of participants, promoting a more holistic involvement in the co-design of interactive artefacts. The design process is illustrated in the InstInt case study. We detail the co-design process, from ideation to construction, of a small-scale interactive installation for public spaces. This process was conducted with Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) students. Results of the study indicate that participation reached the physical prototyping stages of design and the final artefact emerged from the materialisation of participants' different ideas and purposes, illustrating what we call a socioenactive design process. Our design process can be useful for HCI educators and practitioners seeking for new activities and approaches for open-ended scenarios.}

Accordingly, informed design decisions concerning the users’ behavior during search activities can be used in novel approaches for Exploratory Search tools. With regard to users’ behavior on search result selection, literature indicates higher ranked results tend to attract more attention and, therefore, more hits. However, the cause of such behavior is not clear. We experimentally investigate the hypothesis of this behavior being due to ranking. A group of 72 participants was asked to select a search result from a randomly ordered results list. The experiment was carried out on paper to remove specific search engine and digital medium biases. We obtained evidence indicating there is a trend towards choosing higher ranked results even in a different medium and in the context of an Exploratory Search, corroborating to the hypothesis that ranking has influence on users’ select ion behavior.}

  abstract={O objetivo deste trabalho foi o de estudar em profundidade a metodologia de design centrado no usuário para a criação de sites e aplicações web, que são os produtos abordados dentro deste trabalho. Trata-se de uma metodologia que torna o usuário o elemento de maior importância durante todo o processo de design de um produto destinado à web, visando resultar em sites e aplicações com boa usabilidade e alto retorno de investimento. Foram estudadas bibliografias a respeito da experiência do usuário na web e os elementos que a compõem, permitindo o conhecimento de todas as disciplinas envolvidas no design centrado no usuário, bem como a posição e as implicações de cada uma dentro de um projeto. Foram estudadas também bibliografias resultantes de pesquisas com usuários que abordam temas como cognição e percepção visual, com o objetivo de compreender determinados aspectos do comportamento dos usuários e esclarecer paradigmas referentes ao uso da web. Por fim, foi colocado em prática o conteúdo que foi estudado, uma aplicação fictícia foi testada por um grupo de usuários para que fosse analisada sua usabilidade, e com base nos resultados a aplicação foi reestruturada levando em consideração os elementos que constituem a experiência do usuário na web.},

  abstract={Currently, computational technology has become more and more pervasive with computers of different sizes, shapes, and capacities. But technological advancements, although necessary, are not enough to make the interaction with computational technology more transparent, as preconized by the ubiquitous computing. Current computational systems still require a technical vocabulary of inputs and outputs to be interacted with. Within the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), the adoption of the enactive cognition theory can shed light on a new interaction paradigm that bridges the gap between action and perception. Enactive computational systems are a promising subject of research, but their design and evaluation are still hardly explored. Furthermore, enactive systems as already proposed in the literature lack a social context consideration. The objective of this doctoral thesis is to contribute towards the design of computational technology within an enactive approach to cognition, while also being sensitive to social aspects. Therefore, this thesis investigates the concepts of enactive and socioenactive systems by enabling the co-design of interactive art installations. To achieve this objective, a theoretical-methodological framework named "Arte Factus" is proposed to support the study and socially aware co-design of digital artifacts. The "Arte Factus" framework was used in three design studies reported in this thesis: InterArt, InstInt, and InsTime. These studies involved the participation of 105 Computer Science and Computer Engineering undergraduate and graduate students in the co-design of 19 installations. The process involved the use of pervasive "Do-It-Yourself" (DIY) technology, and some of these installations were further studied in workshops of situated practice that took place in educational scenarios (school and exploratory science museum). The "Arte Factus" framework, as the main contribution of this doctoral thesis, has shown effective in supporting the socially aware co-design of interactive installations that materialize the concept of socioenactive digital artifacts. Moreover, through the study of the artifacts created in the context of this investigation, this thesis also contributes towards the theoretical construction of the concept of socioenactive systems.}

  abstract={O design de modelos e ferramentas para auxiliar a Pesquisa Exploratória adquire mais importância conforme a quantidade de informação na Web cresce, pois a atenção do ser humano é limitada e existe a necessidade de se filtrar essa informação. O uso de recursos de busca avançada é uma abordagem viável para a exploração por meio de consultas durante atividades de Pesquisa Exploratória. Entretanto, o uso de tais recursos permaneceu relativamente baixo desde a popularização dos mecanismos de busca na Web, em parte por causa de decisões de design que ignoram a natureza complexa e flexível de atividades de busca. Esta dissertação investiga o design e avaliação de recursos de busca avançada que façam sentido para seus usuários, favorecendo atividades de Pesquisa Exploratória. Como contribuição, este trabalho introduz o Dico: um modelo conceitual de recursos de busca avançada para auxiliar a Pesquisa Exploratória, apresentando e avaliando um conjunto de diretrizes criadas para apoiar designers e avaliadores de ferramentas de Pesquisa Exploratória a projetar melhores recursos de busca avançada, promovendo o seu uso. Como demonstração da aplicação do Dico, o mesmo foi instanciado em uma ferramenta de Pesquisa Exploratória na Web, denominada Dico 01, e foi descrito o processo de inspeção da ferramenta utilizando as diretrizes, que permitiu a identificação de oportunidades de melhora posteriormente abordadas com o design de novas funcionalidades. O Dico foi utilizado e avaliado por 13 designers prospectivos em uma atividade prática. Os resultados indicam que as diretrizes do Dico fizeram sentido para a maioria dos participantes e os auxiliaram a inspecionar um mecanismo de busca, sugerindo a utilidade e a aplicabilidade das diretrizes.}

   abstract={Ambientes computacionais contemporâneos, caracterizados pela ubiquidade e pervasividade da tecnologia, demandam novas formas de pensar a interação de (e entre) pessoas e ambientes populados de artefatos e sistemas computacionais que criamos, com os quais e através dos quais interagimos individualmente e com outros. Tomamos como pressuposto que a ação apresenta-se acoplada à percepção, à emoção e à cognição no processo dinâmico da vida e precisam ser compreendidos como tal. Uma relação interdisciplinar complexa entre a Biologia, a Fenomenologia, a Psicologia e as Neurociências é necessária para a compreensão da relação cérebro-corpo-ambiente. Este Relatório Técnico sintetiza estudos realizados pela equipe do Projeto Socioenativos, buscando caracterizar sistemas socioenativos a partir do referencial teórico do enativismo. Contribui, assim, com fundamentos necessários à construção de bases teórico-metodológicas que sustentem o design e a construção de ambientes computacionais ubíquos.},

Next, we show the preliminary results from the workshop, which include a qualitative analysis of recorded interactions with the three artifacts exhibited and an evaluation of the workshop itself. While the workshop was well evaluated by the participants, the qualitative analysis, in turn, suggests promising socioenactive qualities to be found in the exhibited artifacts, contributing in both theory and practice to the Socioenactive Systems project.
